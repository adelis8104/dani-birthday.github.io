            <h1>Happy Girlfriend Day / Happy Birthday</h1>
            <h3>Dani, thank you for everything. It has truly been a wonderful
            and amazing experience being with you. There has not been a single 
            day that has gone by where you have failed to make me the happiest
            I have ever been, which is one of the many blessings you have given me 
            in life. Every day you bring me joy with your presense. There are 
            so many things that you have done for me it is way too much to type 
            out into words. From the bottom of my heart, Thank you Dani, Thank you
            so so so much. I will cherish these moments and memories with you forever.
            I love you very much.  
            <br><br>I hope all of your birthday plans and wishes go smoothly this 
            year and you can relax. I also hope tina isn't a pain today :smile:
            <br><br>I can't wait to give you a big hug.
